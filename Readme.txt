Language Used: Python
Code Structure: My code has 2 files: “KNN.py” and “school_scores.csv”. KNN.py contains the implementation of my KNN algorithm. I import the data into a pandas data frame object, drop most of the columns, normalize my data and randomly shuffle it. I have multiple functions to calculate the euclidian distance between 2 rows, get the distances between specific data point and all other data points and get the k nearest neighbors to a single data point. I also have some functions to help in setting up the SAT math bucket sizes and a few test functions. My main function asks the user to provide a k value which will be used as the k value in the KNN algorithm.
How to Run the Code: Run “KNN.py” using the following command: “python3 KNN.py”. The Standard output will ask for a k value. Enter any integer (recommended 1-9) and press enter. The program will print an accuracy number which represents how well the algorithm did using the given k value on 25% of the data that is reserved for testing purposes (75% used to train). I randomize the testing and training data each iteration, so accuracies will change every time the program is run even for the same k value. NOTE this program utilizes pandas data frame objects. You will need to have a version of pandas installed in order to run this code.
